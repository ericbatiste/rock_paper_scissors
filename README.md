# Abstract
This application is a digital recreation of the classic children's game, Rock Paper Scissors.  It features two versions of the game that the user can choose to play, the classic version complete with artistic renderings of the three hand gestures used to play the in-person game as well as an extended version that is built off of a constellation theme.  This version features five constellations the user can choose from.  The user plays against the computer, which I've decided to name "Steve" for no reason except that I find it funny.

# Technologies Used / Setup
This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  No other frameworks or technologies are incorperated.  In order to open this project, simply fork the repo if you'd like or just clone it down to your computer by copying the ssh link and pasting it into your terminal following the command 'git clone.'  From there you can navigate to the file and open it from the terminal or from the UI if you choose.

# Future features
For the extended version of the game, I'm ustilizeng just five constellations which are also zodiac symbols. I can see a feature where the user has access to the full list of zodiac constellations and is able to pick and choose which five they would like to play with as well as pick five at random. Currently this application does not utilize local storage; however, that might be something to consider as well.

# Wins / Challenges
One thing that I love about this project is that I my wife, Emily, designed the images used and they really take the visual aesthetic of the project to the next level. You can check out some more of her work at www.studiomente.com.  A challenge that I faced: when initialy designing the data model I was using functions to create objects to store the user and computer information, including number of wins. When it came time to render the score to each players respective container the function would reset the scores to zero each time. I solved this by creating static objects in the place of functions. I think this way makes more sense for this project but I also feel that the dynamic nature of using a function is probably preferred in most scenarios.
